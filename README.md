# Repo Introduction
This repo is my attempt to recreate a project I found on YouTube ([link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi7uR3ItaOY&ab_channel=CodewithIrtiza)) by "Code with Irtiza" that explains how to use Apache Kafka for a simple project. My plan is to start by copying that project and then add more features, like a database, to make the application do more things.

# Project Details
This is a project about how to build a scalable and decoupled backend for an application using Apache Kafka and Python. It's not really matter what this app is (a food ordering app in this case), but it's more about the system that we want to build and how it can scale very easily.

I will build the whole system locally using a locally running Kafka broker, but of course in a production setting you will want to run multiple Kafka instances ina more mature environment.
